=head1 NAME

fapi - A humble command line tool to manage F5 BigIP loadbalancers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Just run

  fapi -h

or

  f -h

because it's shorter to type.

=head1 ABOUT

This is a simple command line client to do basic stuff with the iControl F5 API 
such as:

  Managing Nodes
  Managing Monitors
  Managing Pools
  Managing Virtual Servers


This is a private programming project programmed in my spare time. Therefore I
didn't bother to put it on a public website and github. Please open bug 
reports, feature requests and pull requests at
L<https://github.com/rantanplan/fapi>.

Unzip it and run

  sudo python setyp.py install

You may also install bigsuds from the contrib dir of the fapi source tree.

=head2 iControl reference

Through bigsuds you can do everything what iControl can do:

=head2 Setting up a simple nPath Service

A simple nPath service can be created as follows.

  # Creating two nodes, auto resolve the IP addresses
  f node fooserver1.example.com create
  f node fooserver2.example.com create

  # Creating a pool and add the nodes to it
  f pool foopool create
  f pool foopool add member fooserver1.example.com:80
  f pool foopool add member fooserver2.example.com:80

  # Add a monitor to the pool
  f pool foopool add monitor http_lbtest

  # Create a nPath HTTP service, 'nPath' also auto disables NAT and PAT
  f vserver myservice.example.com:80 create PROTOCOL_TCP nPath

  # Add the pool to the service
  f vserver myservice.example.com:80 set pool foopool

  # Add a nPath HTTPS service
  f vserver myservice.example.com:443 create PROTOCOL_TCP nPath
  f vserver myservice.example.com:443 set pool foopool
